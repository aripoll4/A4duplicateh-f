Wangari's Contribution:
Wangari created the Github repository that we used for the assignment Wangari also created the liveshare on VsCode to code and debug with Alfred.We worked on everything together for the most part. We usually took turns talking about a concept and then one person debugged and monitored as the other person coded.

Help Received:
We did not visit office hours, but we did have personal meetings with Professor Dondero on how to apporach this assignment compared to others.

Sources of Information Used:
Assignment corrections based on our assignment 2 grade 
Multiple sources of code from lecture, the main ones used were PennyFlask and PennyFlaskJinja files 
The HTML library 
Ed Discussion

Time Spent:
A very long time ~ about 20 hours

Assessment of the assignment (Did it help you to learn? What did it help you to learn? Do you have any suggestions for improvement?)
We learned a lot about HTML and how to make our files work on a webpage. I think it was a bit difficult managing work with Spring Break and important due dates for the 333 project.

(Optionally) Any information that will help us to grade your work in the most favorable light. In particular you must describe all known bugs.
