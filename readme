Wangari Karani, Alfred Ripoll

#WebVersion2
The purpose of this assignment is to help you learn or review client-side web programming.

Wangari's Contribution:
Wangari joined the liveshare on VsCode to code and debug with Alfred. We worked on everything together for the most part. We usually took turns talking about a concept and then one person debugged and monitored as the other person coded.

Alfred's Contribution:
Alfred created the Github repository that we used for the assignment. Alfred also created the liveshare on VsCode to code and debug with Wangari. We worked on everything together for the most part. We usually took turns talking about a concept and then one person debugged and monitored as the other person coded.

Help Received:
We went for office hours to understand where we lost points in WebVersion1 so that we could fix them in WebVersion2.

Sources of Information Used:
Assignment corrections based on our assignment 3 grade 
Multiple sources of code from lecture, the main ones used were PennyResponsive and PennyBootstrap files 
The HTML library 
Ed Discussion

Time Spent:
About 10 hours

Assessment of the assignment (Did it help you to learn? What did it help you to learn? Do you have any suggestions for improvement?)
We learned a lot more about HTML, CSS and how to make our webpages more attractive. I think it was a bit difficult figuring out how to get our code to work with the reference files.

(Optionally) Any information that will help us to grade your work in the most favorable light. In particular you must describe all known bugs.
